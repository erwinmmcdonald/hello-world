Hello World First Repo
My name is Maurice McDonald, I'm a student learning Data Science through SMU bootcamp.
I'm a new Business Analyst with WPP IT. I'm looking forward to learning more about dev ops in order to fully understand how I can relate better to dev teams and provide real world solutions and answers for the decision makers in my org and beyond!
I'm here to learn, email me at maurice.mcdonald@uhub.biz for any updates.
